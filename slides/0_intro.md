# Testing apps with Rails and JavaScript
## with Jason Morrison

# Presenter Notes

* Introduce me: used to non-tdd, big QA dept, struggled with tdd, now second nature
* Hands up: Ruby/Rails? JS? Other? -- Testing?
* Way too much ground to comprehensively cover TDD practices, techniques, and tools
* Hoping you find a few interesting things that you can apply right now
* I'm interested in presenting a broad overview for a range of backgrounds, providing follow-up resources for a range of backgrounds, and starting discussion
* Stop me to ask questions or drill down
